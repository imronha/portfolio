        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h5>Developer, Volleyballer, Photographer, and asipiring Polyglot.</h5>
        <p>Born in San Francisco and raised in Sacramento, CA. I graduated from UC Davis in 2012 with a major in Clinical Nutrition and Minor in Japanese and worked at the UC Davis Medical Center for over four years. Working full time and learning how to code on the side was too difficult so I quit and moved to San Jose, CA to pursue Software Development by completing Coding Dojo in September of 2017.</p>
        <p>If I'm not working/coding, you'll probably find me on the volleyball court, taking artsy pictures of every cute animal possible, treating myself to different foods, making short highlight reels of my life adventures, or trying to learn a new language. 様々な外国語ペラペラなりたいよ〜. </p>
